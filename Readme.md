## description
word finder is a bot for the game "Scrabble" that will help you find the optimal word to arrange on the board. The bot uses a super fast trie-based algorithm so you will get hints immediately. Currently supported languages are English and Polish, but you can add your own language if you provide a file with information about letters in your language and a list of words that can be arranged on the board and put both files in the appropriate folder.
